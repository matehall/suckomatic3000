suckomatic3000

Wood pellet suction control. Sucks wood pellet from my ~10m2 storage to a smaller storage from where the pellet burner is feed. Uses an Arduino Uno to control a shop vac that sucks the pellet using a cyclone. Small storage level measured using a ultra sonic sensor and cyclone level is monitor using a photo resistor. Information presented on a 16x2 LCD.


To do:
Add a Nrf2401 and report status to another arduino with LCD.
Report if storage level drops down to minimum level.
Report if furnace stops.
